## Data Editing for the Different Tabs

### Styles Tab Editing

Edit Civil 3D object style property data directly in the table:

#### Editing Property Data Process

2. **Check Objects** - Check specific objects to work with.
3. **Configure Columns** - Use Preferences button to configure table columns.
4. **Edit Properties** - Modify style properties directly in the table.
5. **Save Changes** - Changes are applied.

## Batch Editing

### Multiple Row Data Editing

Edit multiple objects, style or table rows simultaneously for efficient workflow:

#### Selection Process
- **Multi-selection** - Select multiple rows in the table.
- **Bulk Modifications** - Apply changes to one column object and the change will be propagated to the set of selected rows at once.
- **Efficiency** - Save time with bulk operations.
- **Visual Validation** - See which objects or rows are affected by changes based on the status column.
- **Apply Changes** - Apply changes to the modified items.

### Main Component–Subcomponent Relationships in Batch Editing

Since the tool displays all subcomponents, some data may be associated with the main component. Editing a property of the main component can affect multiple rows, because the main component controls several subcomponents.

#### Understanding Main Component–Subcomponent Data
- **Main Component Properties** – Some data belongs to the main component.
- **Subcomponents** – Subcomponents have their own specific data.
- **Multiple Row Impact** – Editing main component properties can impact multiple rows.

#### Main Component Property Editing
- **Main Component Changes** – Changes to main component properties affect all related subcomponents.
- **Cascading Updates** – Updates to the main component automatically update its subcomponents.
- **Bulk Modifications** – Modify main component properties to update several subcomponents at once.

> **Note:** To identify which rows represent subcomponents or main components during batch editing, refer to the **Component** column in the table. The structure and naming in the Component column are explained in the following reference: [Component Column Reference](SH-Object-Label-Table-Styles.md#component-column-reference)

## Missing Object Limitations

Due to current Civil 3D API limitations, Style Helper cannot collect the following style types:

- **Section View Styles** - Drafting buffer outline.
- **Rail Turnout** - All rail turnout related styles.
- **Can't View Styles** - Equilibrium can't line annotation, Applied can't line annotation.
- **Bridge Styles** - All bridge related styles.

These limitations are imposed by the Civil 3D API and are not within the control of Style Helper. We continue to monitor API updates and will add support for these styles when they become available through the Civil 3D API.


## Label Styles Children Component Editing

Style Helper supports children label styles editing capabilities.

Civil 3D has hierarchical component structures for label styles:

- **Parent label Styles** - Main style objects (e.g., Point Label Styles)
- **Child Label Style** - Inside the parent label style it could have additional nested children and subchildren label styles. We are also supporting these.
